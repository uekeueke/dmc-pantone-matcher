dmc-pantone-matcher
===================

Finds colors of DMC floss closely matching a color specified by a Pantone color name.

To use this program, run FlossColors.py in a Python shell and use the function search(pantone, top) with pantone being the name of the Pantone color (e.g. "Process Blue") and top being an optional argument (default 10) specifying how many floss colors you want returned (in order of best match to worst).
